## Description

****

This portfolio is a collection of my projects. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I make more projects. 
The projects are mostly school projects, but there will be some hobby projects in the future. 
The projects are made with different programming languages, such as Java and JavaScript.

I will also upload images of the projects and maybe some of the artwork I have made.
